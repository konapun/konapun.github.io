Figured I'd throw a quick site together to host project demos. This site is
powered by Gatsby and is based on a modified mashup of
[gatsby-starter-resume](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-resume/) and
[gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/)
with some (ongoing) improvements in usability and code quality.

This site is strictly utilitarian; I'm a web developer in my daily job but my
hobbyist projects tend to be more CLI/framework oriented. As a result, this site
isn't meant to be a showcase of my webdev skills so please keep that in mind if
you're browsing this site's source code.
